## How to use a Time Capsule?
1. Buy a Time Capsule from the "Buy Capsule" page. Once bought the time capsule should be visible on the home page.
2. Use your capsule to upload images and provide a title and description for each image.
3. Provide your location and specify the date and time at which this capsule should be unlocked.
4. Done. Your capsule is buried and now anyone can unlock it on the unlock date.

## Why should I bury a capsule?
The internet is filled with fake images and there is no real way to know if an image is really from the past without manual verifiction. 
On Decapsule you can know exatly when a particular image was buried and check its authencity.
Also, when capsules are unlocked the contents of the capsule are for sale and the user who buried the capsule recevies 60% of the sale.

## Why should I unlock a capsule?
Just to go through peoples memories, the past and experience things which your were not aware about. 
Also, unlocking a capsule fetchs you a small amout of SOL.

## How does this work?
Everything is a NFT under the hood, capsules, images buried all are converted to NFTs so all your images are unique to you.
The Decapsle program handles the data associated with each capsule.
